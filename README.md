# Welcome to the SMPL app 

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

# What is it?
The goal of this project is to make calorie tracking easier for people that meal prep. This is done through using Goggle Vision Optical Character Recognition on uploaded recipes. These recipes are then converted to ingredients and corresponding macro information.
